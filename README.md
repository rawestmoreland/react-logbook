# React Pilot Logbook

## Overview

This project is an attempt to create and maintain my own electronic pilot logbook. We'll start off with an MVP1 that will have the following features.

The app will be built using MERN:

-   MongoDB
-   Express.js
-   React.js
-   node.js

Material UI will primarily be used.

There are a few scripts here that will take a csv file as input and format the aircraft and flight data into the appropriate MongoDb documents and collections.

### Flight Log

-   The flight log will be a table with a 'hard-coded' column schema.
-   ~~The flight log will be paginated on the backend and have column totals~~
-   Functionality to add, edit and delete individual flights.
-   Custom node script to upload many flights from a csv to MongoDB

### Aircraft Log

-   Aircraft data will be saved in an aircraft collection.
-   Aircraft-specific columns will be generated by querying the aircraft table and will pull that info from the aircraft collection based on the tail number provided in the add-flight modal.
-   Aircraft log will initially have 'hard-coded' columns.

## Features Wanted

-   Custom flight log columns - Separate collection in MongoDB where the user can configure the layout of the flight log. - There will be a default column scheme, but the user can add to that
-   Currency tracker - Banners and notifications to alert when currency is about to expire for: - SE - ME - Night - CFI - Medical
